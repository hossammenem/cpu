### Roadmap ( i guess )

1. Design Phase
- write CPU specifications (instructions, registers)
- Memory layout (start simple: linear memory space)
- Add basic I/O specifications (for hello world) ( ports typeshit )

2. Implementation Phase
- Write emulator first (not the program)
- Write simple test programs
- Test and debug emulator
- Write assembler
- Write more complex programs

3. Testing Phase
- Write more complex programs
- Debug and refine everything
